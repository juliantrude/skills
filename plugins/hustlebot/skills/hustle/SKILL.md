description: Top-level entry point for the hustle loop — orchestrates everything from zero to a running cross-session goal chain in the current project. Use when the user wants to start hustling on a long-running goal, says "/hustle", "set up the loop here", or wants Claude to keep working on something across sessions.

# hustle — from zero to a running goal chain

You orchestrate the full lifecycle. Walk these phases **in order**, skipping
any phase that is already satisfied. Tell the user which phase you're in.

## Phase 1 — Install (skip if `<project>/.hustle/` exists)

Follow the `/loop-setup` skill: run `scripts/hustle-setup.sh <project-dir>`
from this plugin's root. It creates `.hustle/` (runtime scripts + config), the
platform scheduling (systemd unit on Linux), and smoke-tests the scheduler.
If the smoke test fails, stop and debug before going further — a broken
scheduler means a chain that silently dies.

## Phase 2 — Plan (skip if GOAL.md exists and is `STATUS: READY` or beyond)

Follow the `/grill-goal` skill: explore the project first, then grill the user
one question at a time (recommended answer included) until North star,
Definition of Done, Working Agreements, and a dependency-ordered increment
plan are nailed down. Output: a loop-ready `GOAL.md`, `STATUS: READY`.

If a GOAL.md exists but looks half-finished (unfilled placeholders, empty
plan), treat it as input to the interview, not as ready.

## Phase 3 — Pre-flight check (never skip)

Confirm with the user before igniting — this is the last human checkpoint
before an unattended agent starts committing and pushing on its own:

1. Show a 3-line summary: the north star, the first increment it will tackle,
   and the configured model/effort from `.hustle/config`.
2. Point out the permission mode (`HUSTLE_SKIP_PERMISSIONS` in the config) and
   what it means.
3. On Linux: check `loginctl show-user $USER --property=Linger`; if linger is
   off, tell the user the chain dies at logout and give them the
   `loginctl enable-linger $USER` command.
4. Check for a peer chain — every chain on the machine draws on the same
   subscription, so two at once burn the budget twice as fast and race each
   other into the session limit:

   ```bash
   .hustle/bin/hustle-session.sh --check-peers   # 0 = clear, 3 = one is working
   ```

   On exit 3 the log names the project. **Do not ignite.** Tell the user which
   chain is working and ask whether to stop it (`systemctl --user stop
   hustle-<their-slug>.service` plus `hustle-scheduler.sh disarm` in that
   project) or to wait. A finished peer needs no question — the check retires
   its leftover monitor by itself.

   Headless runs make the same check and simply park for 5 minutes; only here,
   with a human present, is it worth asking.

   The same check logs `[peer] stale unit …` for any chain whose project
   directory is gone. Surface those to the user with the `hustle-setup.sh
   --uninstall <path>` line from the log — but never run it for them
   unasked: an unmounted disk is indistinguishable from a deleted project,
   and the units may belong to work they still want.
5. Ask explicitly: start now?

## Phase 4 — Ignite

- Linux: `systemctl --user start hustle-<slug>.service`
- macOS: `nohup .hustle/bin/hustle-session.sh >/dev/null 2>&1 &`

(`<slug>` is `HUSTLE_SLUG` from `.hustle/config`.)

Then verify ignition instead of assuming it:
- within ~30s the run should be visible (Linux: `systemctl --user is-active
  hustle-<slug>.service` = `activating`; both platforms: `.hustle/run.pid`
  exists and the pid is alive),
- the monitor should answer on `http://localhost:<HUSTLE_PORT>/api/status`.

Report to the user: monitor URL (with the machine's LAN address if
determinable), how the pacing works (one increment → ~2 min gap → next run;
parks at session/week limits and resumes on reset), and the kill switch
(`.hustle/bin/hustle-scheduler.sh disarm`).

## If the user asks for status instead of setup

Don't re-run phases — read `GOAL.md` + `.hustle/status.json`, check whether a
run is active (`run.pid`) and what's armed (`hustle-scheduler.sh next`), and
summarize. Point at the monitor URL for the live view.
